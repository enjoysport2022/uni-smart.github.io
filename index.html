We introduce Uni-SMART (Universal Science Multimodal Analysis and Research Transformer), a pioneering scientific multimodal model by DP Technology, aimed at revolutionizing the efficiency of scientific document analysis.
In the realm of research, the exhaustive review of literature stands as pivotal yet notably labor-intensive tasks.
In drug discovery, for instance, practitioners must delve into an expansive corpus of literature to identify key functional areas of targets and active molecules.
Traditional rule-based databases, like Sci-Finder, offer search capabilities but still necessitate manual filtration and perusal of a vast number of documents.
Uni-SMART bridges this gap by combining multimodal search features with natural language processing, enabling automated, precise extraction of relevant data from domain database.
It surpasses conventional text-only models by integrating multimodal elements such as tables, equations, and chemical structures.
Such multimodal alignment innovation allows Uni-SMART to deliver a nuanced understanding of scientific literature, outperforming other unimodal language models in comprehension and response accuracy.
Uni-SMART represents a significant leap forward in the domain of scientific literature review, providing a powerful tool for researchers to rapidly assimilate and interact with complex multimodal data.

              Advances in deep learning have greatly improved structure prediction of molecules. However, many
              macroscopic observations that are important for real-world applications are not functions of a single
              molecular structure, but rather determined from the equilibrium distribution of structures. Traditional
              methods for obtaining these distributions, such as molecular dynamics simulation, are computationally
              expensive and often intractable. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, called
              Distributional Graphormer (DiG), in an attempt to predict the equilibrium distribution of molecular
              systems. Inspired by the annealing process in thermodynamics, DiG employs deep neural networks to
              transform a simple distribution towards the equilibrium distribution, conditioned on a descriptor of a
              molecular system, such as chemical graph or protein sequence. This framework enables efficiently
              generating diverse conformations and provides estimations of state densities. We demonstrate the
              performance of DiG on several molecular tasks, including protein conformation sampling, ligand structure
              sampling, catalyst-adsorbate sampling, and property-guided structure generation. DiG presents a
              significant advancement in methodology for statistically understanding molecular systems, opening up new
              research opportunities in molecular science.
