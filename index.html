                We introduce Uni-SMART (Universal Science Multimodal Analysis and Research Transformer), a pioneering scientific multimodal model by DP Technology, aimed at revolutionizing the efficiency of scientific document analysis.
                In the realm of research, the exhaustive review of literature stands as pivotal yet notably labor-intensive tasks.
                In drug discovery, for instance, practitioners must delve into an expansive corpus of literature to identify key functional areas of targets and active molecules.
                Traditional rule-based databases, like Sci-Finder, offer search capabilities but still necessitate manual filtration and perusal of a vast number of documents.
                Uni-SMART bridges this gap by combining multimodal search features with natural language processing, enabling automated, precise extraction of relevant data from domain database.
                It surpasses conventional text-only models by integrating multimodal elements such as tables, equations, and chemical structures.
                Such multimodal alignment innovation allows Uni-SMART to deliver a nuanced understanding of scientific literature, outperforming other unimodal language models in comprehension and response accuracy.
                Uni-SMART represents a significant leap forward in the domain of scientific literature review, providing a powerful tool for researchers to rapidly assimilate and interact with complex multimodal data.
